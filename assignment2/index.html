           <p> Yoga is a practical aid, not a religion.
            Yoga is an ancient art based on a harmonizing system of development for the body, mind, and spirit.
            The continued practice of yoga will lead you to a sense of peace and well-being,
            and also a feeling of being at one with their environment.
            This is a simple definition.
           </p>
            <br />
           <p> Think of this practice as being the means and tools to realign and rebalance your vehicle (body) on a regular basis.
            You take control and you can then become your body mechanic instead of having to pay someone else to do it (medical professionals).
            Because your body is finely tuned you will find that your chances for injuries and illnesses will drop as you are in a much more attuned state.
            You don't want for something major to happen to you before you decide to do something about it.
            That's reactive behavior and that's going to set you back big time, all you have to do is take action now Yoga is Easy to do.

                For most people getting old is a decision they make whether they know it or not.
                It basically comes down to the saying â€“ Useit or lose it! Old age and the associated illnesses that come with it are big business,
                so therefore people in the western world especially are not encouraged to look after themselves.
                Everyone is worth more in the health business when they are sick.
